Pojo Sidebars generates as many sidebars as you need. It then allows you to place them on any Post, Page or Custom Posts Type in your WordPress site.

== Description ==

With Pojo Sidebars you can create as many sidebars you need for any page you want. Especially for themes based on [Pojo Framework](http://pojo.me/?utm_source=wp-repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=sidebars).

You can easily separate your site into sections, as well as set  a specific sidebar for every single page or custom post type.

You can replace any sidebar with a different one by embedding it in the Text Editor with a unique shortcode.

<strong>Display a sidebar using a built-in shortcode:</strong>

<code>[pojo-sidebar id="ID"]</code>

<strong>Display a sidebar using a WordPress function:</strong>

<code><?php dynamic_sidebar( 'pojo-sidebar-ID' ); ?></code>
